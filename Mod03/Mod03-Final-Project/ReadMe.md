# Northwind Database Project - Allison Kelly
This project is for the Flatiron School Data Science program. It is an exploration of the Northwind Traders Dataset,
an opensource database released by Microsoft with the Office Suite. Typically, it is used to practice SQL queries, however the following Jupyter notebook attempts to complete hypothesis tests utilizing Python.
