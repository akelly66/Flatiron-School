    "In this lesson, you'll practice doing a power-analysis during experimental design. As you've seen, power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows you to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",

    "* Describe the concept of “Power” in relation to p-value and effect size for hypothesis testing\n",
    "* Understand and critically evaluate the factors influencing the power of an experiment\n",
    "* Perform Power calculation using SciPy and Python\n",
    "* Demonstrate the impact of sample size on statistical power using simulations\n",

Half will be randomized to a placebo group and half to the protein supplement treatment group and the trial will be carried out over one month. It is desired to see whether the mean change in percentage of liver fat from baseline to the end of the study differs between the two groups in the study. \n",
