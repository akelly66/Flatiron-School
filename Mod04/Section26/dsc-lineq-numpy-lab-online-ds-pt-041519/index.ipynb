    "\n",
    "Now you've gathered all the required skills needed to solve systems of linear equations. You saw why there was need to calculate inverses of matrices, followed by matrix multiplication to figure out the values of unknown variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises in this lab present some problems that can be converted into a system of linear equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a system of equations from given problem by creating matrix and vectors in NumPy\n",
    "* Calculate the inverse and dot-product to get the values for unknown variables.\n",
    "* Solve linear equations using `numpy.linalg.solve()`\n",
