    "Leveraging machine learning and AI with the massive amounts of consumer history, web traffic, and product reviews can have a measurable impact on marketing campaigns. By harnessing the power of statistical and analytical tools, patterns untracked by basic dashboards can be unearthed, translating into higher conversion rates over traditional marketing strategies. The following notebook is one such demonstration of this power.\n",

    "Part one explores customer purchase history on the <a href=\"https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/\">Google Merchandise Store.</a> By using machine learning, I will predict the customer lifetime value (CLV) of each customer. This data can then be used to segment ads, email marketing campaigns, and other traditional marketing ventures. I will also predict and measure customer attrition which can be used to develop proactive prevention strategies and increase revenue. \n",
